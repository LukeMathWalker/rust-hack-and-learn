# Rust (Remote) Hack & Learn: Join Us!

We are organizing a full day **remote** Hack & Learn on **February 27th 2021**, starting at 8:00 GMT (European/African timezone block)!

## The backstory

Good talks are only half of the appeal of a local meetup.
The other half is the community: getting to know like-minded people, hacking on a new problem together, elbow-to-elbow, learning from more experienced practitioners.

The [Rust London User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/) has been somewhat successful in porting talks to the remote-first world we now live in, but the same cannot be said for our *Hack & Learn* events.  
Sharing a physical space makes it is easier to join a group hacking together (pacman rule!), while meetup regulars can be on the lookout for new joiners who need a bit of support to find their space.  
The same dynamics do not happen _spontaneously_ on a Discord server.

Should we give up on remote *Hack & Learns*? Hell no!  
We embrace the fact that online interactions have to be more _intentional_ - therefore we are willing to try a new format (largely inspired by the hack days of RustFest 2019).

## How it is going to work

### Before the event

To make it easier for people to find partners to work with (or to join projects they might have never heard of before!) we have created this GitHub repository.

**Ahead of the date, we will use the repository to organize groups for the event.**

If you have an idea for a project, [open an issue](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/rust-hack-and-learn/issues/new?assignees=&labels=project%2C+open&template=project-proposal.md&title=%5BProject+proposal%5D+%3CName+of+the+project%3E) with a short project description to find other folks who'd be interested to work on it with you.  
If you prefer to join an existing project, comment on the [open project issues](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/rust-hack-and-learn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproject+label%3Aopen)!

There is no definition of "the right project": the Hack & Learn is an occasion to tinker and explore.

Are you looking for folks to work through the Rust book? That's a great project!  
Do you want to work on a PR to close an issue on the compiler? Equally awesome!  
Do you have a fuzzy picture in your mind for a crate that is missing in the ecosystem? Go ahead!

You can submit an idea even if you won't be at the event - e.g. if you are the maintainer of an OSS project and you'd like to see some folks contributing/tackling some open issues.

### The day of the event

On the day of the event, we'll provision a Discord server.  
One room to coordinate the work on every project.
People can then use VSCode LiveShare, screen sharing or any other tool they think suits them to collaborate on the code itself.

It's an experiment: if it works, it'll be awesome. If it doesn't, we tried our best.

There will be a team of moderators to make sure everything works out smoothly according to our Code of Conduct.

See you there!
